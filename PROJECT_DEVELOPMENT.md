# Year 9 CT Task 3

## Phase 1
### Question
My question for this project is: "What is the main demographic of people likely to listen to a new hard rock band, and what is their favourite style?". This question is open-ended and allows me to look at a lot of different kinds of data relating to this.

### Hypothesis
#### Senior boys are more likely to listen to a hard rock band, and they'd love the more heavy metal style.

---

My hypothesis is: "Senior boys are more likely to listen to a hard rock band, and they'd love the more heavy metal style". The reason for this hypothesis is that senior boys have often performed metal tracks at Battle Of The Bands and the school's talent show, so they're more likely to enjoy it.

### Functional And Non-Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements:  
- Successfully load the dataset
- Clean any missing data by using the mean for the category (or deleting it depending on the category)
- Should show the percentage of people either likely or certain by age and gender
- Can also show the amount of people either likely or certain by age and gender
- Should be visualised in a Matplotlib chart
- Charts should be downloadable, and the cleaned dataset should be exported to a `.csv` file  

Non Functional Requirements:  
- User Interface should be simple and easy to use
- UI should function well
- UI should try to be in an app, but text based can be used if necessary
- System should correctly display errors to users
- System should have a error system and display the right errors.

### Use Case
Actor: User

Goal: To access and interact with existing data through the programâ€™s user interface.

Preconditions:

The dataset has already been preloaded into the system by a programmer.

The user has access to the system interface.

Main Flow:

User opens the program and is presented with an app. It opens to a menu with some options.

User selects one of the following options:
a. View visualisation (e.g., chart or graph of selected data)
b. Search or filter data based on specific criteria

System performs the requested action and outputs to user.

Postconditions:

User has viewed and/or interacted with the data.

Any valid updates are saved by the system.

Data remains available for further queries or analysis.

## Phase 2
### Current Information
There is currently no data on this topic, as that kind of data hasn't been analysed before/.
