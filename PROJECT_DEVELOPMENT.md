# Year 9 CT Task 3

### Question
My question for this project is: "What is the most popular Australian rock album?"

### Hypothesis
#### Back In Black is the most poplar Australian rock album

---

My hypothesis is: "Back In Black is the most popular Australian rock album". This stems from the fact that 
### Functional And Non-Functional Requirements
Functional Requirements:  
- Successfully create and load the dataset
- Clean any missing data by using the mean for the category (or deleting it depending on the category)
- Should be visualised in a Matplotlib chart
- Charts should be downloadable, and the cleaned dataset should be exported to a `.csv` file  

Non Functional Requirements:  
- User Interface should be simple and easy to use
- UI should function well
- UI should try to be in an app, but text based can be used if necessary
- System should correctly display errors to users
- System should have a error system and display the right errors.

### Use Case
Actor: User

Goal: To access and interact with existing data through the programâ€™s user interface.

Preconditions:

The dataset has already been preloaded into the system by a programmer.

The user has access to the system interface.

Main Flow:

User opens the program and is presented with an app. It opens to a menu with some options.

User selects one of the following options:
a. View popularity of artists (as a chart)
b. View most popular songs (as a chart)
c. View main demographic listening to the artists (as a chart)

System performs the requested action and outputs to user.

Postconditions:

User has viewed and/or interacted with the data.

Any valid updates are saved by the system.

Data remains available for further queries or analysis.

## Phase 2
### Current Information
I can access data directly from Spotify, which I intend to do for this assessment. For the purpose of keeping the dataset a decent size and unbiased, I am going to be looking at the following artists: AC/DC, The Screaming Jets, Cold Chisel, Jimmy Barnes, Ian Moss, Noiseworks, Icehouse, The Angels, Midnight Oil, Rose Tattoo, INXS, Australian Crawl, and The Choirboys. I can access data for total streams on songs and albums, and use that to form my dataset.
